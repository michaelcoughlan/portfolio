                    <p>
                        In Fidelity, I was part of the frontend team modernising user journeys to retain existing clients and have the
                        potential to bring in new ones also. We worked in two week sprints in which developers were fully responsible
                        for bringing picking up tasks and ensuring they were deployed to production. This gave me some exposure to AWS,
                        in particular Lambdas, monitoring, S3 buckets and their CI/CD pipelines.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As well as the actual development in React, we were also in charge of reaching 100% coverage in our Jest unit tests
                        and creating automation tests with Cucumber and Selenium.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Any features which required communicating with the backend team would also need mocks to be created to simulate the
                        API response until the backend API was ready, which was achieved with Wiremock. This would allow developers to transform
                        the mocked data into the format the frontend required and prevent any delays in development.

                    <p>
                        In Ammeon, I worked as a fullstack developer implementing new features as well as bug fixing for a
                        client's internal marketplace. The team was using Angular for the frontend with Protractor for
                        automation testing.

                    <p>
                        On the backend we used Node.js to communicate with Wordpress (which admins used to create guides and
                        blogs for end users), MongoDB (for storing Gerrit commit statistics for gamification on the marketplace)
                        and Elasticsearch (queried Wordpress to add search functionality to the frontend).

                    <p>
                        I was lucky enough during my time in Deloitte Digital to work on some really exciting greenfield
                        projects in the immigration sector. The first of which involved creating a centralised location for
                        immigration experts to input work permit requirements for supported countries and then a client facing
                        online assessment which would use that data to determine if a candidate was eligible to work in the
                        destination country.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        The second was moving the Right to Work process into a web application to avoid needing to do it in person
                        or via email. This involved working with 3rd party vendors to verify users matched their submitted documents
                        (via Onfido) and externally storing them until the process was complete. Both applications used React in the
                        frontend and Node.js in the backend. The development and production environments were achieved with Docker,
                        Gitlab CI/CD and Google Cloud Platform.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Outside the immigration projects I worked on two Proof-of-Concepts which were purely frontend roles
                        but I did get a chance to work with teams using Blockchain and AWS services.

                        I started IBM at the beginning of 2017 as a graduate and learned the basics for most of what I know today. I was
                        part of some brilliant teams who mentored me (thank you in particular to <strong>Albert Hristov</strong>) and
                        taught me topics such as frameworks, ORMs, CI/CD, cloud computing, scrum, how to communicate effectively with
                        clients, etc.

                        of a team building a proof of concept to read emails and create ServiceNow tickets automatically based on
                        keywords and also as a frontend developer for a well known retailer, developing features and bug fixing on
                        their e-commerce site.

                        was the answer to that as well as giving me the opportunity to play around with Google Cloud for
                        deploying, configuring Nginx and practicing CSS animations. It's really basic and doesn't leverage
                        any frameworks, everything is built with plain old HTML and CSS. I wanted to try and avoid using
                        JavaScript to see how far it could get me!

                        waiting for the Promise to resolve / reject before moving on to the next item in the queue.
